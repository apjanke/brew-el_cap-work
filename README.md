#  brew-el_cap-work

This repo is my personal work on getting Mac Homebrew [ready for OS X 10.11 El Capitan](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/40837).

The code in here isn't going to be widely useful or reusable.

###   What's in here   ###

Most of this is scripts for doing installs from source of all the formulae in Homebrew core. It has some logic for tracking progress, following dependencies, and avoiding redundant installs of formulae whose dependencies fail.
